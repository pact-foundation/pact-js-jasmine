# Archived

This project is archived because it seems to never have had any code in it. If you're looking for a jasmine wrapper for pact, please open an issue on https://github.com/pact-foundation/jest-pact - it would only require small changes to be jasmine specific, we just haven't released one because we don't think many people are using Jasmine directly these days.
